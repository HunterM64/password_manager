# M64 Password Management System
I got tired of creating and remembering passwords for all the accounts I have to create for all the internships I apply for, so here's my simple solution, written in Python.

As you can see this creates VERY strong passwords, guaranteed!!!

<h2>Current functionality:</h2> 
<ul>
    <li>you input how long you want the password, it gives it to you</li>
    <li>it copies said password to your clipboard</li>
    <li>something of a management application</li>
</ul>
<h2>Planned functionality:</h2> 
<ul>
    <li> a BETTER management application that keeps track of the password and the website associated to it</li>
    <li>a gui for all this</li>
    <li> a .exe file</li>
    <li> convert this into a C program using Python as the GUI that calls the C functions </li>
</ul>
