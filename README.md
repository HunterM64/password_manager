# password_manager
tired of creating and remembering passwords for all the accounts I have to create for all the internships I apply for

current functionality: 
<ul>
    <li>you input how long you want the password, it gives it to you</li>
</ul>
planned functionality: 
<ul>
    <li>it copies said password to your clipboard</li>
    <li> a management application that keeps track of the password and the website associated to it</li>
    <li>a gui for all this</li>
    <li> a .exe file</li>
</ul>
make sure to smash that star button and watch for any updates!!!
