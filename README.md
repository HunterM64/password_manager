# M64 Password Management System
I got tired of creating and remembering passwords for all the accounts I have to create for all the internships I apply for, so here's my simple solution, written in Python.

As you can see this creates VERY strong passwords, guaranteed!!![^1]

# Usage
To run the program, run command 
```bash
python3 window.py
```
There might also be a `.exe` file in the releases tab. 

# TODO 
<ul>
<li>update the readme when I'm "done" again</li>
<li>some kind of encryption</li>
</ul>
