# M64 Password Management System
I got tired of creating and remembering passwords for all the accounts I have to create for all the internships I apply for, so here's my simple solution, written in Python.

As you can see this creates VERY strong passwords, guaranteed!!![^1]


# Dependencies

If you aren't using the `.exe` file, you might need to install some dependencies. 

Tkinter can be installed by running

```bash
pip install tk
```

If you're on Mac, I just went through that process myself but I don't remember all of it, so good luck. It's something along the lines of 
```zsh
brew install python
brew install python-tk
pip3 install tk
```

# Usage

To run the program, run command 
```bash
python3 window.py
```
There might also be a `.exe` file in the releases tab for you Windows users.

<li>some kind of encryption</li>
